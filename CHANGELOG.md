# K Framework 3.6 #

## General ##
- Maude backend has been discontinued. Please try to convert your
  definition to the Java backend. If you run into trouble and a particular
  feature is not supported, please report the feature to us so we can fix it.
  Limited support for K 3.5 will continue until the release of K 4.0. We will
  backport bug fixes if necessary. K 4.0 will be released when the
  Java backend is deemed a suitable complete replacement for maude.
- Removed the `K_NAILGUN` environment variable: K now uses nailgun whenever
  it is able to connect to a K server.
- Added an option `-w2e` to convert all warnings that are not suppressed by the current warning level into errors.
- `K_OPTS` environment variable now overrides default JVM settings instead of replacing them.
- Many other bugfixes too numerous to list exhaustively. Refer to pull requests on GitHub or contact
  a K developer for more specific details.

## K Language Syntax ##

- Users may now use both "requires" and "require", and both "imports" and "import".
- Non-anonymous variables may now contain underscore characters.
- Added an "initial" cell attribute whose effect is to ensure that a multiplicity ? or *
  cell is part of the initial configuration even if it contains no configuration variables.

## Kompile ##

- The `--directory` option now defaults to a value equal to the directory containing
  the main definition file, rather than the current working directory.

## KRun ##

- `krun --output raw` has been removed. If you are interested in disabling
  pretty-printing, it is recommended that you try `krun --output kast`.
- KRun is now much faster. For a complete list of updates, refer to closed pull requests
  on GitHub.
- Added the `--exit-code` flag, which specifies a pattern that is matched once rewriting
  terminates in order to determine a value to return as the exit code of KRun. For more
  details on how this works, refer to the manual.
- Modified the behavior of `--output pretty` so that several of the more computation-intensive tasks were not performed. Users interested in the old behavior may now use the new `--output sound`.

## Standard Library ##

- Added `maxValueFloat` and `minValueFloat` functions returning the highest and lowest-magnitude floats for a particular precision and exponent range.
- Added an `isInfinite` function which returns whether a particular float represents one
  of the infinities.
- Added a `#configuration` function which returns the current subject configuration being rewritten.
- Fixed random number generation function.
- Added a 2-argument Float2String method that takes a MPFR printf format string to use to format the floating point number.

## Developer API ##

- The KRunResult class has been removed. It contained two fields, `statistics`
  and `rawResult`. If you are developing a feature that cannot work effectively
  without one or both of these fields, please file an issue so that we can
  evaluate your case and attempt to come up with a new API.
- The `kompileOptions()` and `krunOptions()` methods of `AbstractKModule` now
  take a class literal instead of an object. The object is constructed from
  the class by dependency injection (i.e. via a 0-args or `@Inject`-annotated
  constructor)
- The LTL model checker interface (currently in use by a third-party plugin) now accepts
  LTL formulas in the form of a string and is expected to parse them internally using
  a plugin-specific format.
- External parsers are now expected to output abstract syntax using the new KORE syntax
  found in k-distribution/include/builtin/kast.k

## Java Backend ##

- Removed `--pattern-matching` flag and made this behavior the default. Added
  `--symbolic-execution` flag, preserving old behavior.
- Added the `--audit-step` flag. Users may specify a step of execution in the java
  backend with `--audit-step` and a rule with `--audit-line` and `--audit-file`.
  The rewriter will then output information indicating whether the rule at that
  location was executed successfully at that step and if not, why not.
- `--statistics on` now prints information on the time spent executing
  the top 10 most expensive-to-compute functions.
- Many improvements made to the K verifier. K verifier is now capable of verifying
  C programs using the C semantics.

# K Framework 3.5 (released 2014-12-19) #

## General ##
- Discontinued compatibility with Java 7.
- Added an API for users to extend the K framework by means of extending
  the interface KModule or the abstract class AbstractKModule. Support for:
    - Adding a new backend to Kompile.
    - Adding a new backend to KDoc (see section "Kompile" below).
    - Adding new options to kompile.
    - Adding new options to krun.
    - Adding new hooks to the Java backend.
- Added commands "kserver" and "stop-kserver" to create a local server
  to run K commands on, implemented using 
  [Nailgun](http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/). The server
  is automatically enabled whenever `kompile`, `krun`, `ktest`, `kast`, or
  `kdoc` is run when the `K_NAILGUN` environment variable is set to a 
  nonempty string. Running applications with nailgun is an experimental
  feature, subject to certain bugs, but it can be used to increase the
  speed of executing K programs by a factor of 3-7x.
- Migrated build system from Ant to Maven. For information on building
  K, refer to the [developer README](src/README.md).
- Removed the `--backend symbolic` option from the distribution.
  UAIC in Iasi intends to support this functionality using the generic
  K plugin interface (see "General" above).
- Removed the `kagreg` tool from the distribution.
- Removed the `--debug-gui` KRun option from the distribution.

## K Language ##
- Changed the KLabel for UserList terminators to `'.List{"<KLabel>"}` 
  instead of `'.List{"<Separator>"}`. This allows for a broader range
  of syntaxes for user lists, as well as the possibility of custom
  KLabels.
- Changed the syntax of fresh variables from `rule foo => N when fresh(N:Int)`
  to `rule foo => ?N:Int`.
- Added a syntax for fresh constants: `rule foo => !N:Int`.
- Added a syntax for adding attributes to arbitrary terms:
  `<Term>::Sort{attributes}`
- KResult is now a subsort of KItem.

## K Standard Library ##
- Changed sorts List, Map, Set to be subsorts of KItem. The tool translates
  these K expressions into builtin lookups, updates, and selections on the
  underlying data structures.
- Changed the syntax of set inclusion: SetItem(1) in SetItem(1) no longer
  returns true. This is to distinguish between a set of elements and a set
  of sets.
- Removed operations ==Set, ==List, ==Map, =/=Set, =/=List, =/=Map. The
  correct syntax now is to use ==K for all of these.
- Changed the syntax of Map update from `Map [ Value / Key ]` to
  `Map [ Key <- Value ]`.
- Added a new Map difference operator `-Map`.
- Renamed Map update operator `updateMap`.
- Separated implementation of Map, List, Set, and MInt sorts from their
  specification in separate `-impl.k` files.
- Added syntax predicates isPascalCaseId and isCamelCaseId to refer
  to Ids which begin with an uppercase or lowercase letter respectively.
- Added a new builtin function #system which operates like the system()
  syscall.

## Parsing ##
- Added a type interencer based on context for the sorts of variables.
- Correct the behavior of associativity on productions not of the form
  `syntax Sort ::= Sort1 "op" Sort2`
- Added a new syntax for case insensitive terminals:
  `syntax Sort ::= 'terminal'`
- Added new attribute "noAutoReject" in order to allow users to provide
  an infinite set of tokens _not_ to reject.
- Removed the "cons" attribute which was an artifact of the SDF implementation.
- Added the `--java-parser` and `--java-parser-rules` options to test the
  experimental new parser written in Java.
- Added the K function `#parseInModule` which allows the user to parse input
  in the syntax of a particular K module.
- Added a friendly error message when the SDF parser crashes.

## Pretty Printing ##
- Added code which indents Map/List/Set elements from their parent collections.

## Kompile ##
- Added a new option `--legacy-kast` which preserves the old behavior of
  several pieces of functionality which were specific to the Maude
  implementation.
- `kompile --backend [pdf|latex|html|unparse|unflatten|doc]` has been
  moved to a new tool, `kdoc --format [pdf|latex|html|unparse|unflatten|doc]`
- Modules are required to import or declare constructors for sorts that they
  use. In the event of a circularity, a forward reference can be introduced
  using the syntax `syntax Sort` without any declared productions.
- Added prototype of `--backend coq`.
- Removed deprecated experimental options `--kore`, `--lib`, `--loud`,
  `--non-symbolic-rules`, `--symbolic-rules`, `--rule-index`, `--test-gen`.

## Kast ##
- The default output of `kast` when the `--legacy-kast` flag is not set on
  `kompile` is now the new KORE syntax which will be utilized by K 4.0.
  This allows users to write external parsers that output this syntax
  in the Java rewrite engine, a previously unsupported feature.
  For information about the new syntax, refer to
  [the syntax of KORE](https://github.com/kframework/k/blob/kast-in-K/samples/kast/kore.k). Currently 
  only the KSEQ module is supported by the parser.

## KRun ##
- Using JCommander to parse KRun options. See notes for version 3.4 under
  "Kompile" for details.
- Added option `--coverage-file` to tell KRun to output rule coverage
  information.
- Added code to normalize the values of semantic variables in the output
  of KRun.
- Added support for greater configuration of KRun output modes, including
  using `--output` combined with `--debugger` and others.
- Added new output mode "kast" to represent un-concretized KAST terms.
- Changed syntax for setting a command line parser from 
  `--config-var-parser <parser> -cPGM=<term>` to `-pPGM=<parser> -cPGM=<term>`.
- Removed option `--backend`. Backend is now specified in kompile and read
  from the compiled definition.
- Removed deprecated options `--main-module` and `--syntax-module`. These values
  are now read from the compiled definition.
- Renamed option `--debug-info` to `--debug` for consistency with other tools.
  Previous `--debug` for the debugger was renamed to `--debugger`.
- Changed option `--ltlmc` to accept only formulas. A file may be specified
  with the `--ltlmc-file` option.
- Removed deprecated experimental options `--index`,
  `--indexing-stats`, `--generate-tests`, `--load-cfg`.

## KTest ##
- Improved the output of KTest to display a message for each running
  process only when that process is actually run.
- Add a "Running" message to KTest for compilation and pdf generation stages.
- Fixed a minor display issue when using `ktest --dry`.
- Using JCommander to parse KTest options. See notes for version 3.4 under
  "Kompile" for details.
- Improved parallelism of KTest by using a common task queue for all
  processes to be run.
- Changed ordering of KTest execution to execute programs for each definition
  immediately following compiling that definition.
- `ktest --debug` now propagates `--debug` to the `kompile`, `kdoc`, and
  `krun` processes it generates.

## Java Rewrite Engine ##
- Significant improvements to the performance and stability of the rewriter.
- Support for rules tagged "anywhere" as long as they rewrite a KItem to a
  KItem.
- Added support for nested cells of multiplicity * in unification-based
  rewriter.
- Added support for `--superheat` and `--supercool`.
- Added support for rules tagged `function` which do not have a rewrite
  at the top.
- Added support for a `--trace` flag in the matching-based rewriter 
  which prints a list of applied rules.
- Added increased error logging when the rewriter fails with an error.
- `--search` now respects `--transition`.

## Verification ##
- Updated Z3 API to 4.3.2 beta build bb56885147e4.
- Added substantial additional support for verifying static specifications of
  programs using the `--prove` option, which takes a K file containing
  reachability rules to verify. Features include:
    - SMTLib support for various operations on bit vectors, integers, lists,
      floats, and booleans.
    - An "smt-lemma" attribute which translates a particular rule into
      an SMTLib lemma to be used during sat-solving.
    - A "lemma" attribute which treats a rule as a lemma during proving
      to be additionally verified.
    - Conversion from functions with an "smtlib" attribute to
      uninterpreted functions in SMTLib.
    - Support for arbitrary bit width of bit vectors variables 
      using "bitwidth" attribute and the new term attribute syntax.
    - Support for arbitrary precision and exponent range of floating point
      variables using "exponent" and "significand" attributes and the
      new term attribute syntax.
    - A "pattern" attribute which specifies an associative-commutative-aware
      configuration abstraction, such as a list or list segment data structure
      in a heap.
    - A `--smt_prelude` option to KRun which specifies a prelude to be prepended
      to SMT queries.
    - A `--z3-executable` flag to use a separate process for SMT when
      z3 crashes due to a bug.
    - A "trusted" attribute which specifies that a particular reachability
      rule should be assumed sound instead of being proven.
    - Options `--z3-cnstr-timeout` and `--z3-impl-timeout` to set the Z3 timeout
      for checking constraints and implications, respectively.
- Removed support for gappa: z3 now handles all the same functionality.

## Miscellaneous ##
- Added a friendly error message when the tool throws an uncaught exception:
  `Uncaught exception thrown of type ...`
  If you see this error message, please file a bug so that we can either
  add a better error message, or fix the functionality that caused the error.
    - Also added a flag --debug which provides developers with the original
      stack trace.
- Changed the name of the K temp directory to `.<ToolName>-<Date>-<UUID>`.
- Improved error logging in cases where exceptions are caught by K code.
- Converted the K tutorial to use the Java backend for execution instead
  of Maude.
- Removed a number of unused files from the repository.
- Moved the `editor-support` folder to the separate repository 
  [k-editor-support](https://github.com/kframework/k-editor-support).
