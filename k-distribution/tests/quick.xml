<!-- 
Very quick regression ktest. 

Be very reluctant in adding any new tests here. Ideally, this test 
will run a single definition (at least until we have very good incremental
compilation) 

If you want to test a particular scenario, add it to the special kool definition 
used for the quick ktest.
