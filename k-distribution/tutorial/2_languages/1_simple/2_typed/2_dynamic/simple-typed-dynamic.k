/*@ \section{Abstract}
This is the \K dynamic semantics of the typed SIMPLE language.
It is very similar to the semantics of the untyped SIMPLE, the
difference being that we now dynamically check the typing policy
described in the static semantics of typed SIMPLE.  Because of the
dynamic nature of the semantics, we can also perform some additional
checks which were not possible in the static semantics, such as
memory leaks due to accessing an array out of its bounds.  We will
highlight the differences between the dynamically typed and the
untyped SIMPLE as we proceed with the semantics.  We recommend the
reader to consult the typing policy and the syntax of types discussed
in the static semantics of the typed SIMPLE language. */

The ``undefined'' construct is now parameterized by a type.
A main difference between untyped SIMPLE and dynamically typed SIMPLE
is that the latter assigns a type to each of its locations and that
type cannot be changed during the execution of the program.  We do not
do any memory management in our semantic definitions here, so
locations cannot be reclaimed, garbage collected and/or reused.  Each
location corresponds precisely to an allocated variable or array
element, whose type was explicitly or implicitly declared in the
program and does not change.  It is therefore safe to type each
location and then never allow that type to change.  The typed
undefined values effectively assign both a type and an undefined value
to a location. */
