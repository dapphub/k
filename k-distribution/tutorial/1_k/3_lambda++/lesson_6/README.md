### Wrapping Up and Documenting LAMBDA++

[MOVIE [6'23"]](http://youtu.be/xfvx6Ss5PcA)

In this lesson we wrap up and nicely document LAMBDA++.  In doing so, we also
take the freedom to reorganize the semantics a bit, to make it look better.

See the `lambda.k` file, which is self-explanatory.

Part 3 of the tutorial is now complete.  Part 4 will teach you more features
of the K framework, in particular how to exhaustively explore the behaviors
of non-deterministic or concurrent programs.
